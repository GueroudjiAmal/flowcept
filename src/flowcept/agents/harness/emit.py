"""Write provenance records.

The default (and always-on) sink is a per-session JSONL file whose records are
byte-for-byte the dicts Flowcept itself buffers — ``{"type": "workflow"|"task"|
"agent", ...}``. That means the buffer is directly consumable by
``flowcept --generate-report --input-path <file>`` and by
``flowcept.agents.harness flush`` with no conversion step.

An optional online sink publishes the same dicts to the Flowcept message queue.
It is off by default because it would add a Redis round-trip to every keystroke-
adjacent hook.
