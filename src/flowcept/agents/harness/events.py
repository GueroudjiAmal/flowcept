"""The harness-independent event shape.

Every adapter's only job is to turn its harness's native event into one of
these. The recorder then knows nothing about Claude Code, Codex, or OTel.

Like :class:`~flowcept.agents.harness.config.Config`, this is a plain slotted class
rather than a dataclass: hooks are short-lived processes and the ``dataclasses``
import costs more than everything this module does.

class HarnessEvent:
    """A normalized lifecycle event from some AI coding harness.

    Attributes
    ----------
    kind:
        One of :class:`flowcept.agents.harness.vocab.EventKind`.
    harness:
        Harness identifier, e.g. ``claude_code``, ``codex``, ``langgraph``.
    session_id:
        The harness's own session identifier. All provenance IDs derive from it.
    timestamp:
        When the event happened. For an event that completes something (a tool
        result, a finished turn) this is the end.
    started_at:
        When the completed work *began*, for sources that report a duration in
        one event rather than a pre/post pair -- an OTel span, or an SDK
        callback. ``None`` means the recorder should fall back to the start it
        saw earlier, or to ``timestamp``.
    source:
        Why the event fired: session start reason, end reason, compact trigger.
    agent_name:
        Subagent type/name, e.g. ``Explore``. ``None`` means the main assistant.
    agent_ref:
        The harness's own subagent identifier, used to pair start with stop.
    raw:
        The untouched source event, kept in ``custom_metadata.raw_event``.
